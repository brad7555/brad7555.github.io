													<h3>Thoughts on creation </h3>
												</header>
												<p>As my group and I were coming up with ideas for a software solution,
													we all had one thing in common: Love of traveling. We started to plan out the entire 
													project, starting with some basic drawings of the home page on a white board, 
													as well as writing out our thoughts and wishes for the scope of the project.

											<h3>Saved Routes</h3>	
										<p>After the route is created and saved, you can view it, along with all of the other saved routes  
											within the database. This page has many different functions running at one time. You can like any of
											the routes that you see, as well as sort all of the routes by a specific tag. These little sections 
											are just touching the surface of the work we put into this piece of software. The 
											<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZkAS-uhGBY">demo video</a> does a very good job
											at explaining all of the functionality that comes along with this application.

												<h3>The Crown jewel</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Creating a route was the main idea behind this project. This is the very first page 
												that we as a group designed, and it really got things started on a good note. Javascript
												is the main driver behind this page. The map, and both of the lists are updated independently, 
												as are the liked establishments and the shortest route functions.
